# DeFiAnalytics

DeFiAnalytics is a platform that provides users with insights and analytics for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across various blockchain networks. It offers a comprehensive dashboard where users can monitor and analyses metrics such as total value locked (TVL), liquidity, trading volume, yields, and other key performance indicators (KPIs) of DeFi protocols.

## Directory Descriptions

- **.vscode:** This directory contains configurations and settings for Visual Studio Code. It may include files related to workspace settings, debugging configurations, and extensions.
- **config:** This directory typically holds project configuration files such as environment variables, database configurations, and other settings required for the project to run.
- **defi_frontend:** This directory contains front-end components for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. It usually includes components like buttons, navigation bars, stylesheets, and the main entry point file (index.js).
  - **components:** Contains reusable React components used in the DeFi front end.
  - **styles:** Contains CSS or SCSS files defining styles for the DeFi front end.
- **mydefi:** This directory includes custom components or modules specific to your DeFi project.
  - **contracts:** Contains Solidity files defining smart contracts for the DeFi application.
  - **tokens:** Contains JavaScript files defining token-related logic for the DeFi application.
  - **README.md:** Provides additional information about the custom DeFi components and modules.
- **security_key_management:** This directory contains code related to security key management, often used for encryption, decryption, and authentication purposes.
  - **encryption:** Contains files related to encryption algorithms such as AES and RSA.
  - **authentication:** Includes files for user authentication processes like login and signup.
  - **README.md:** Offers more details about the security key management module.
- **securitycodescan.Test:** This directory contains code for security code scanning and testing.
  - **scan_results:** Contains reports or logs generated from security code scans.
  - **tests.py:** Includes Python test files for security code testing.
- **smart_contracts:** This directory holds Solidity files defining smart contracts used in the project.
  - **solidity:** Contains Solidity code files defining various smart contracts.
  - **README.md:** Provides additional information about the smart contracts used in the project.

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone 
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd DeFiAnalytics
```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
4. Install backend dependencies:
```
cd ../backend
npm install
```

6. Start the frontend and backend servers:
In one terminal window/tab
```
cd ../frontend
npm start
```
7. In another terminal window/tab
```
cd ../backend
npm start
```

9. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the DeFiAnalytics dashboard in your web browser. The dashboard provides insights and analytics for various DeFi protocols, allowing you to monitor trends, track metrics, and make informed decisions regarding your DeFi investments and strategies.
