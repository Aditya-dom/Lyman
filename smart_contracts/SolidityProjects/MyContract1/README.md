# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:
contract address = 0x2B6B330a9e542CC3888BB7a765FC2B95d52359ac
 [contractAddress](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2B6B330a9e542CC3888BB7a765FC2B95d52359ac)
```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
